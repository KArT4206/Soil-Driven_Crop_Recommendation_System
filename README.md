# Soil-Driven_Crop_Recommendation_System
A crop recommendation system built in R that suggests the best crop to grow based on soil parameters like N, P, K, pH, humidity, and rainfall. Uses machine learning models to aid data-driven, sustainable farming decisions.

# ðŸŒ¾ SmartCrop: Crop Recommendation System using Soil Data

SmartCrop is a machine learning project built using **R** that predicts the most suitable crop based on various **soil and climate parameters** such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, pH, Temperature, Humidity, and Rainfall.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Predicts ideal crop using soil input values
- Built with machine learning models (Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.)
- Visualizations for data analysis
- Supports sustainable and data-driven farming

---

## ðŸ§ª Technologies Used

- **R Programming**
- Libraries: `caret`, `randomForest`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`
- Developed in RStudio / Jupyter Notebook with IRKernel

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. Input soil parameters (N, P, K, temp, humidity, pH, rainfall)
2. Model processes the input using a trained classifier
3. Returns the most suitable crop to grow
